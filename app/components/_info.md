## ðŸ”¹ Atoms

**Keywords:** Elements, Basics, Primitives, Units

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of the design system. They represent the smallest functional units in an interface.

- Examples:
  - Buttons
  - Inputs
  - Labels
  - Icons
  - Colors
  - Typography styles

## ðŸ”¸ Molecules

**Keywords:** Compounds, Assemblies, Clusters, Modules

  - Search bar (input + icon)
  - Badge with icon

## ðŸ”· Organisms

**Keywords:** Components, Structures, Systems, Entities

Organisms are more complex UI components formed by combining molecules and/or atoms. They are standalone units of interface.

- Examples:
  - Navigation bar
  - Card with image, title, and description
  - Sidebar with menu items

## ðŸ§© Templates

**Keywords:** Layouts, Blueprints, Frameworks, Scaffolds

- Examples:
  - Login screen
  - User profile page
  - Product detail view
